create in python a remote access tool a client(GUI but hidden) and server (CLI and GUI (if activated by command !stream)) app named MedusaX like TeamViewer                                                             
The server can on client:                                                                                                            
🎥 Stream Desktop (live Screen sharing with digital keyboard) 
📷 Webcam stream Note no capture but live stream                                                                                                                                 
🖥️ Shell (Send CLI commands)                                                                                                            
👥 Client List (See connected clients add can select the client to control)                                 
Note: The client can't do nothing. when the client execute the code it will hid ethe window make it advanced like TeamViewer  and like rdp run on 0.0.0.0 port 9999 use pyqt5 add generate a digital keyboard to see the keys Note the server will control the client not the server control the server itself no simulations! add commands for webcam and screen stream screen use command !stream it will generate one square with screensharing and a little square at top right corner where will be the webcam add show clients ips using command !list when showing clients add print client ip and if client ip selected print client ip (selected) ad to control this user add if user wnat control other client add to download a file must put command !download (filename or filepath) when executing command !download send the file to a discord webhook only press enter and print [ * ] Sending...  after [+] Sent! and thats all pass to the next command so primary the server is in CLI but to activate the gui miust put command !stream add to control a new target put command !set target (traget ip) add to stop contoling target put command !remove target (target ip) if gui activated stop in this case add prompt to server: "medusax >" (the space is intentional) dont put the prompt at least that one client connected
and when one client conencted automaticly select if two do nothing 
dont put [-] No target selected. prevent to dont remove all targets only can remove one target by one not all
to idnetify only this commands !set target !remove target nd !download only to prevent that the shell commands aren't confused with server comamnds and i said add shell commands. Note the client and server is for windows dont short it implement full what i said !
